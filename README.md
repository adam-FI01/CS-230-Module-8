The Gaming Room was asking for their game "Draw It or Lose It" to be created into a multi-platform web-based game. It would involve having the game work on all operating systems and popular browsers. 

I felt that I ended up coding pretty well because of the overall results of it. I had everything that needed to show with both the admin and user pages showing. One thing that I felt like I could improve on is the UML diagram. I found what I made was very confusing and didn't make a whole lot of sense. I made sure to learn from my lessons and be better next time as developers would need to read and trust the diagram. 

I found that the documents really did help me develop the code. Having the UML diagram showed all of the methods that the application should need plus the inheritance and uses cases of them. With this, it helped make sure that the user needs were met throughout the project. This is important as the user needs are made to help serve both the customers and business. Without these needs, there would not be a point of the new application. 

I first approached the design of the software by making the UML chart. This was helpful as it showed what everything required. This trickled down as it made every other step have a purpose.
